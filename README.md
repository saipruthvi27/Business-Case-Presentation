#### Topic - Air France Internet Marketing: Optimizing Google, Yahoo!, MSN, and Kayak Sponsored Search

A case study of Air France was provided to understand the market performance of this airline based on prices, rating and offers available on different search engine marketing platforms. 

The data from the case study was transferred to an excel spreadsheet as raw data. This raw data was loaded into R Studio, which processed and filtered it, generating the needed insights and analysis.

Kindly go through all the documents for a much more detailed and scripted analysis.

This project was made possible by a team of 4 postgraduate students and the team members contributed effortlessly to make this analysis.
